      <p class="first">STAT it’s time for you to write your own vision statement, give it your best shot! Don’t worry 
        about trying to make it perfect the first time. Begin a conversation with yourself and try to 
        envision how you want your business to be, in terms of growth, values, contributions to society, 
        employees, etc. List down the strongest words you can think of – words that trigger emotions for
         you. This will inspire and help you craft your company’s vision statement.
        Once you have defined your vision, you can start devising strategies to move your organization 
        toward that vision. Make sure you also incorporate your vision within your branding</p>
